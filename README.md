# Music Store Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of a Music Store Dataset using Python and MySQL. The project focuses on extracting, transforming, loading, and analyzing data from the dataset to gain insights into various aspects of the music industry, customer behavior, and sales trends. The analysis is complemented by visualizations to provide a clear understanding of the findings.

## Motivation

The primary motivation behind this project was to explore the world of data analysis by working with a real-world dataset from the music industry. By combining programming skills with database management and data visualization techniques, this project aims to provide valuable insights into music consumption patterns, customer preferences, and other relevant metrics.

## Dataset

The Music Store Dataset consists of various tables, including albums, artists, customers, employees, genres, invoices, tracks, and more. The dataset covers a wide range of information, including song details, customer transactions, employee details, and genre classifications.

## Key Highlights

- Data Extraction and Loading: The project involves reading CSV files, transforming data, and loading it into a MySQL database using Python.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Various SQL queries are used to explore different aspects of the dataset, such as sales by country, customer spending, top artists, popular genres, and more.
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries are utilized to create visualizations that aid in understanding trends, patterns, and relationships in the data.
- Custom Modules: Custom Python modules are used for database operations and formatting, enhancing code modularity and readability.
- GitHub Repository: The entire analysis process, code, and visualizations are shared in this GitHub repository, making it accessible for collaboration and further exploration.
